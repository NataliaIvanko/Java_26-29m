Sweden has found a new leak in a major undersea pipeline carrying Russian natural gas to the EU - making it the fourth discovered this week.

Denmark and Sweden reported gas leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines earlier this week, raising the possibility of a deliberate attack.

The EU blamed sabotage - but didn't directly point the finger at Russia.

Russia dismissed suggestions that it had attacked its own pipelines as "predictable and stupid".

Instead, the Kremlin's foreign minister said the blasts occurred in "zones controlled by American intelligence".
